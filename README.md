# JavaAssignment

Implementation of a Sorting and Searching Algorithm in data structures for my "Programming with Java" module.
Current implementation:

-Updated BubbleSort.java by adding a FileWriter that takes the results of the sort and writes them to a new file("BubbleSortResults")
-Removed SaveToFile.java
-Removed sorted.txt
