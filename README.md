Implementation of a Sorting and Searching Algorithm in data structures for my "Programming with Java" module.

Currently at: Working with bubble sorting specifically testing a class and method. The class was hardcoded to sort 20 words. The end goal is to implement and use the bubbleSort method within ArrayTest to sort the words that have already been placed within an array.(The 20 random words from 100.txt)
